[Rules]
[Rules] Our map contains some random generated valuable resources
[Rules]
[Rules] Our miner has the capability to either dig or sleep
[Rules] 	- dig - miner extracts a random resource and puts it into the backpack
[Rules]		- sleep - while sleeping a resource decays from the map
[Rules]
[Rules] The player will have to tell the miner what to do in order to gather as many 
[Rules] valuable resources as possible. 
[Rules]
[Rules] Note 1: If you dig too much you might only find useless resources.
[Rules] Note 2: If you sleep too much all the valuable resources might decay!

[Rules] Play responsibly & good luck!
